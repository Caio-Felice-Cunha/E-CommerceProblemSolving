Where should this company invest: web or app?

## This is the 1st version

## Business Problem
> Data source: The data used in this project is fictitious, created by the Data Science Academy team, but represents real data for e-commerce companies. The data represent one month of operation of the ecommerce portal. The title of each column in the dataset is self-explanatory.

An e-commerce company markets products through its website and through its mobile app.<br>

To make a purchase, a customer registers on the portal (using the website or app). Each time the customer logs in, the system records the time spent logged in, either on the app or on the website. For each customer, the company keeps a sales record with the total amount spent per month.<br>

The company would like to increase sales, but the budget allows it to invest only in the website or app at this time. The objective is to improve the customer experience while navigating the system, increasing the time logged in, increasing engagement and, consequently, increasing sales.

## Solution Strategy
As our goal is to predict which investment will have the greatest result so that the company can have a better return, we will use supervised learning for regression, creating different versions of the model with different algorithms and going through the entire Machine Learning process from end to end.
* Step 01: Exploratory Data Analysis;
* Step 02: Correlation Analysis between variables;
* Step 03: Data pre-processing and division between training data and test data;
* Step 04: Standardization of training data and test data;
* Step 05: Machine Learning Models - Linear Regression and Residual Analysis of the data;
* Step 06: Machine Learning Models - Ridge Regression and Residual Data Analysis;
* Step 07: Machine Learning Models - Lasso Regression and Residual Data Analysis;
* Step 08: Choice of the Best Model and data prediction;
* Step 09: Conclusion and Interpretation.

## Next Steps
* Accepting suggestions.
